      description: "Description: Only present for multi-rank configurations. Background: Reads to the same rank can be performed back-to-back. Reads to different ranks require additional gap dictated by the register RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap. This is to avoid possible data bus contention as well as to give PHY enough time to switch the delay when changing ranks. The uMCTL2 arbitrates for bus access on a cycle-by-cycle basis; therefore after a read is scheduled, there are few clock cycles (determined by the value on diff_rank_rd_gap register) in which only reads from the same rank are eligible to be scheduled. This prevents reads from other ranks from having fair access to the data bus. This parameter represents the maximum number of reads that can be scheduled consecutively to the same rank. After this number is reached, a delay equal to RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap is inserted by the scheduler to allow all ranks a fair opportunity to be scheduled. Higher numbers increase bandwidth utilization, lower numbers increase fairness. This feature can be DISABLED by setting this register to 0. When set to 0, the Controller will stay on the same rank as long as commands are available for it. Minimum programmable value is 0 (feature disabled) and maximum programmable value is 0xF. Feature limitation: max_rank_rd feature works as described only in the mode in which one command at the DDRC input results in one DFI command at the output. An example of this mode is: BL8 hardware configuration (MEMC_BURST_LENGTH=8) and Full bus width mode (MSTR.data_bus_width=2'b00) and BL8 mode of operation (MSTR.burst_rdwr=4'b0100). In modes where single HIF command results in multiple DFI commands (eg: Half Bus Width, BL4 etc.), the same rank commands would be serviced for as long as they are available, which is equivalent to this feature being disabled.

Therefore, performing refreshes in a burst reduces the per-refresh penalty of these page closings. Higher numbers for RFSHCTL.refresh_burst slightly increases utilization; lower numbers decreases the worst-case latency associated with refreshes. 0 - single refresh 1 - burst-of-2 refresh 7 - burst-of-8 refresh For information on burst refresh feature refer to section 3.9 of DDR2 JEDEC specification - JESD79-2F.pdf.

In DDR4 mode, according to Fine Granuarity feature, 8 refreshes can be postponed in 1X mode, 16 refreshes in 2X mode and 32 refreshes in 4X mode.
