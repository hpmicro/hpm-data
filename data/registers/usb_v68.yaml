NOTE: After the status phase of the SET_ADDRESS descriptor, the DCD has 2 ms to program the USBADR field. This mechanism will ensure this specification is met when the DCD can not write of the device address within 2ms from the SET_ADDRESS status phase.

For those designs that contain both host & device capability, the controller defaults to an idle state and needs to be initialized to the desired operating mode after reset. For combination host/ device controllers, this register can only be written once after reset. If it is necessary to switch modes, software must reset the controller by writing to the RESET bit in the USBCMD register before reprogramming this register. For OTG controller core, reset value is '00b'. 00 - Idle [Default for combination host/device] 01 - Reserved 10 - Device Controller [Default for device only controller] 11 - Host Controller [Default for host only controller].

This mode ensures that when the RX and TX buffers are sufficient to contain an entire packet that the standard double buffering scheme is disabled to prevent overruns/underruns in bandwidth limited systems. Note: In High Speed Mode, all packets received are responded to with a NYET handshake when stream disable is active. Host Mode: Setting to a '1' ensures that overruns/underruns of the latency FIFO are eliminated for low bandwidth systems where the RX and TX buffers are sufficient to contain the entire packet. Enabling stream disable also has the effect of ensuring the TX latency is filled to capacity before the packet is launched onto the USB. NOTE: Time duration to pre-fill the FIFO becomes significant when stream disable is active. See TXFILLTUNING and TXTTFILLTUNING [MPH Only] to characterize the adjustments needed for the scheduler when using this feature.
