The watchdog timer gets triggered with the programmed value after the Rx DMA completes the transfer of a frame for which the RI status bit is not set because of the setting in the corresponding descriptor RDES1[31]. When the watchdog timer runs out, the RI bit is set and the timer is stopped. The watchdog timer is reset when the RI bit is set high because of automatic setting of RI as per RDES1[31] of any received frame.

This bit is not functional in the GMAC-CORE configuration in which the Tx clock gating is done during the LPI mode. If the LPITXA and LPIEN bits are set to 1, the MAC enters the LPI mode only after all outstanding frames (in the core) and pending frames (in the application interface) have been transmitted. The MAC comes out of the LPI mode when the application sends any frame for transmission or the application issues a TX FIFO Flush command. In addition, the MAC automatically clears the LPIEN bit when it exits the LPI state. If TX FIFO Flush is set in Bit 20 of Register 6 (Operation Mode Register), when the MAC is in the LPI mode, the MAC exits the LPI mode. When this bit is 0, the LPIEN bit directly controls behavior of the MAC when it is entering or coming out of the LPI mode.

      description: Deferral Check When this bit is set, the deferral check function is enabled in the MAC. The MAC issues a Frame Abort status, along with the excessive deferral error bit set in the transmit frame status, when the transmit state machine is deferred for more than 24,288 bit times in the 10 or 100 Mbps mode. If the MAC is configured for 1000 Mbps operation or if the Jumbo frame mode is enabled in the 10 or 100 Mbps mode, the threshold for deferral is 155,680 bits times. Deferral begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but it is prevented because of an active carrier sense signal (CRS) on GMII or MII. The defer time is not cumulative. For example, if the transmitter defers for 10,000 bit times because the CRS signal is active and then the CRS signal becomes inactive, the transmitter transmits and collision happens. Because of collision, the transmitter needs to back off and then defer again after back off completion. In such a scenario, the deferral timer is reset to 0 and it is restarted.

The wkupfmfilter_reg register is a pointer to eight wkupfmfilter_reg registers. The wkupfmfilter_reg register is loaded by sequentially loading the eight register values. Eight sequential writes to this address (0x0028) write all wkupfmfilter_reg registers. Similarly, eight sequential reads from this address (0x0028) read all wkupfmfilter_reg registers.

Similarly, the almost-full preset values for the 16-bit counters are 0xF800 and 0xFFF0.
