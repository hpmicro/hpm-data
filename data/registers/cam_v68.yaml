      description: DMA Transfer Done in Frame Buffer1. Indicates that the DMA transfer from RxFIFO to Frame Buffer1 is completed. It can trigger an interrupt if the corresponding enable bit is set in CAM_CR1. This bit can be cleared by by writing 1 or reflashing the RxFIFO dma controller in CAM_CR3. (Cleared by writing 1) 0 DMA transfer is not completed. 1 DMA transfer is completed.
